This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Supabase Setup

This project uses Supabase for database functionality. To set up:

1. Create a Supabase account and project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a table called `game` with at least the following columns:
   - `winner_id` (text)
   - `profit` (numeric)
3. Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and update with your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```
4. Restart your development server if it's already running

## Stats Page

Visit `/stats` to see a bar chart visualization of the maximum profit for each winner in the game table.
