Poker Game Simulation with Claude NPCs

Objective:
Develop a poker game simulation where AI-driven players—referred to as Claude NPCs—compete against each other. The application should provide a real-time viewing experience of the game, with an interface to customize the number of AI players and a game engine to manage the poker gameplay.

Requirements:

User Interface (UI):

Create an intuitive UI that allows the user to specify the number of Claude NPCs participating in the game.
Include controls for starting, pausing, and resetting games.
Provide a real-time display of game progress, including player actions, bets, and game state updates.
Game Engine:

Design a robust game engine to handle all aspects of the poker game:
Card shuffling and dealing.
Managing betting rounds (e.g., pre-flop, flop, turn, river).
Tracking player actions (bet, call, raise, fold) and game state.
Determining hand rankings and the winning player(s) at the end of each round.
Ensure the engine can handle multiple rounds and maintain a seamless transition between games.
Claude NPC Integration:

Integrate AI logic for Claude NPCs that simulates realistic poker strategies.
Ensure each Claude NPC makes decisions based on the current game state and typical poker strategies (bluffing, betting patterns, risk management, etc.).
Allow for future enhancements to the AI, such as learning from previous games or adapting strategies.
Real-Time Gameplay Experience:

Provide visual feedback to the user, showing the game’s progression and the decision-making process of the Claude NPCs.
Implement animations or transitions that clearly indicate card deals, bets, and wins.
Optionally, include statistics or commentary that explain key moments during the game.
Extensibility and Maintenance:

Design the application with a modular architecture to facilitate future updates or feature additions (e.g., additional game modes, advanced AI behaviors, multiplayer support).
Ensure code quality, documentation, and testability to support long-term maintenance.
Deliverables:

A fully functional poker game simulation that meets the requirements above.
Source code with appropriate comments and documentation.
A user guide explaining how to set up, run, and interact with the game.
